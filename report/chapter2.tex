\chapter{Technologies}\label{ch:technologies}
With Solidity\footnote{https://github.com/ethereum/solidity} we implement the smart contract which will run on the Ethereum blockchain platform. For our front-end we choose using React\footnote{https://reactjs.org/}, which is a JavaScript library for building user interfaces. The interaction of the front-end application with our smart-contract is provided through Web3.js\footnote{https://web3js.readthedocs.io/en/1.0/} and MetaMask\footnote{https://metamask.io/}. To speed up the testing and development we use Ganache\footnote{http://truffleframework.com/ganache/} to run our local Etherum blockchain
In the following section we describe the different technologies and its use in our project more in detail.

\section{MetaMask}
\section{Ganache}
%which technologies are used and why --> should we go into detail? maybe a chart showing how they interact?
