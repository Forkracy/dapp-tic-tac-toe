\chapter{Technologies}\label{ch:technologies}
With Solidity\footnote{https://github.com/ethereum/solidity} we implement the \ac{sc} which will run on the Ethereum blockchain. For our front-end we choose using React\footnote{https://reactjs.org/}, which is a JavaScript library for building user interfaces. The interaction of the front-end application with our \ac{sc} is provided through Web3.js\footnote{https://web3js.readthedocs.io/en/1.0/} and MetaMask\footnote{https://metamask.io/}. Furthermore, the application provides also the possibility to interact with a localhost provider using Ganache\footnote{http://truffleframework.com/ganache/} as Ethereum node
In the following section we describe the different technologies and its use in our project more in detail.

\section{Web3.js}
\section{MetaMask}
\section{Ganache}
%which technologies are used and why --> should we go into detail? maybe a chart showing how they interact?
