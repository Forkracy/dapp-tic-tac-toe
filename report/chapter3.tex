Figure \ref{fig:project_structure} shows the project structure and the interaction between the different systems by the example of an Player choosing a tile on the board.
The web-application is running on the Heroku Platform\footnote{https://www.heroku.com/}. Through the browser and MetaMask a User can get verified by its Ethereum-account and pay the requested amount of gas in order to run functionalities on the Ethereum smart contract. The smarct contract itself runs on an blockchain, which can be either a private or the Ropsten Testnet\footnote{https://ropsten.etherscan.io/}.\\
The smart contract firstly checks if the move is valid. Secondly it looks for a winner and changes the game state if so. After that it returns a move confirmation to the user.
