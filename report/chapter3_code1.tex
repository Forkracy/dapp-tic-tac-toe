The code of the playMove function is shown in Listing \ref{lst:move}. This gets called when a player clicks on a tile in order to make his move.The game id is sent as an parameter (line \ref{line:param}). With this id the corresponding game object can be called through a mapping (line \ref{line:mapping})  It adds the players symbol into the specific location within the game-board firstly (line \ref{line:boardX} and \ref{line:boardO}). Afterwards it calls the 'checkForWinner' function (line \ref{line:winnerX} and \ref{line:winnerO}). The event MoveMade (line \ref{line:event}) is triggered returning the user an confirmation of the move (line \ref{line:emit1} and \ref{line:emit2}). There is also an an auto completion for the last move if there is no winner set yet (line \ref{line:lastMove}).
